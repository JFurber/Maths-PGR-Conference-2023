The purpose of the current study is to establish a modelling framework to understand the movement of European badgers (Meles meles) within their environment. It is widely understood that badgers play a crucial role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), where bTB is a serious disease of cattle and has a significant economic impact on farmers. However, despite all the GPS data, ecologists still do not understand what they can learn from the data about fine-scale badger movement. A key research question we would like to answer is can we generate a dynamical model to explore badger movement?
 
To model the movements, we are using energy potentials, primarily seen in physics to describe particle motion. Such an approach has been successful in describing the movements of free-ranging elk and their avoidance of vehicles and humans but has yet to be applied to the study of badgers.
 
The model is created using data driven methods, where it is parametrized using GPS data. The modelling framework will allow us to answer key ecological questions: How does badger movement affect the spread of bTB? How does the weather affect badger movement? With the role badgers play in the spread of bTB, the answer to these questions could be crucial in the role of strategy planning.
 
We present results on the parameterized model with the data. This includes the generation of an energy potential and the estimation of a noise term. We have also analysed the differences between male and female badgers to understand different transitions. By simulating these differences, we have created a dynamical model that explores badger movement, and we can now start answering the key ecological questions.
